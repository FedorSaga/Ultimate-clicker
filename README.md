# Ultimate Clicker

**Version 0.0.1**

This is clicker game made on python. Yet it's most basic game that has just a button and click counter.

# Shop

Right now I am developing shop. Near to the click counter will be points. You will get themn for clicks too,
but you can spend them in shop for some boosts. For example 2x boost will double your points per click. The click counter
will not be effected by the boosts.

# Saving

Later on I will try to add some kind of stat saving, so if you will close the program, points and total clicks will be saved.

# CPS (clicks per second)

Also I might add CPS counter, so you could see how quickly can you click and maybe race with your friends!
